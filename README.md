## Downloads
1. **Datasets.** We use two datasets in our work:
- **TREC CAR.** Click [here](http://trec-car.cs.unh.edu/datareleases/) to download the official TREC CAR benchmarks. The experiments in the paper are based on the following two benchmarks: `benchmarkY1-train` and `benchmarkY2-test`. Please download these datasets and the associated qrels. 
- **Entity Aspect Linking.** Click [here](https://www.cs.unh.edu/~dietz/eal-dataset-2020/entity-aspect-linking-2020.html) to download the EAL dataset.
2. **Aspect Linked Corpus.** Click [here](https://www.cs.unh.edu/~dietz/eal-linked-wiki-paragraphs-v0.9/) for more information on entity aspects and to download the aspect-linked TREC CAR corpus used in this work.
3. **Our features and other data**
Click [here](https://unh.box.com/s/oj9bsxlfl5cwusi9iboo61rib1di3lhd) to download a tar file which contains the passage rankings, entity rankings, support passage rankings, various ground truth files, feature files, etc. used in this work. 

## Running the code
The code is partially in Java and partially in Python. The code has been tested using Java openJDK 13 and Python 3.7. The java code required Maven 3 to be installed. 

To install the java code: 
- Clone this repository using `git clone`. 
- Inside the repository, there are two folders: java (containing the java code) and python (containing the python code). From the java directory, run the following command: `mvn clean install`. This should create a jar file called `SIGIR2021-Short-Final-Code-Release-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` inside `java/target`.

You may now run this jar file using `java -jar SIGIR2021-Short-Final-Code-Release-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` along with various command line arguments (see below)  to create the features for training. 

The folder "python" contains scripts for the following:
1. `bert_entity_rerank.py`: Entity re-ranking using [BERT-as-a-service](https://github.com/hanxiao/bert-as-service).
2. `create_query_id_to_name_mapping.py`: Script to create a mapping from TREC CAR entity-ids to entity-names.
3. `create_query_annotations.py`: Script to annotate TREC CAR queries using TagMe.
4. `entity_rerank.py`: Re-implementation of the entity ranking method from [Gerritse et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02843).

The python scripts have a help function which may be called using the `--help` option with then script. For example, `python entity_rerank.py --help`. 

## Reading the aspect-linked TREC CAR corpus
The TREC CAR data can be read using the official `trec-car-tools` available [here](https://github.com/TREMA-UNH/trec-car-tools). We use the Java version in this work.

Below is a code snippet in Java to read the aspect-linked corpus. 


```
 BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(filePath));
 for(Data.Paragraph paragraph : DeserializeData.iterableParagraphs(bis)) {
 
     // Get the entities in the paragraph
     List<String> entityList = getEntities(paragraph);
     
     // Do something else
 }
```

```
 /**
   * Method to return all entities in a paragraph.
   * @param paragraph Represents a Wikipedia paragraph with entity links preserved.
   * @return List of entities in the paragraph 
   */
   List<String> getEntities(@NotNull Data.Paragraph paragraph) {
        List<String> entityList = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Iterate over the body of the paragraph
        for (Data.ParaBody body : paragraph.getBodies()) {
        
            // If you found a link
            if (body instanceof Data.ParaLink) {
                Data.ParaLink paraLink = (Data.ParaLink) body;
                
                // Get the linked section, that is, entity aspect
                String linkSection = paraLink.getLinkSection();
                
                // Get the anchor text of the link
                String anchorText = paraLink.getAnchorText();
                
                // Get the Id of the Wikipedia page
                String pageId = paraLink.getPageId();
                
                // Get the title of the Wikipedia page
                String pageName = paraLink.getPage();
                
                // We put everything into a JSON Object
                JSONObject entity = new JSONObject();
                entity.put("mention", anchorText);
                entity.put("linkPageId", pageId);
                entity.put("linkPageName", pageName);
                entity.put("aspect", linkSection);
                entityList.add(entity.toJSONString());
            }
        }
        return entityList;
    }
```

## Learning-to-rank and ENT-Rank
- We perform our learning-to-rank experiments using the toolkit `ranklips`. Read about it [here](https://www.cs.unh.edu/~dietz/rank-lips/).
- We use an easy-to-use ranklips version of [ENT-Rank](https://www.cs.unh.edu/~dietz/appendix/ent-rank/) called `ent-ranklips`. Read about it [here](https://www.cs.unh.edu/~dietz/ent-rank-lips/).
