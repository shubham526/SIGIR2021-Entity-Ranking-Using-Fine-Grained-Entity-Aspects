# Entity Ranking Using Fine-Grained Entity Aspects
Shubham Chatterjee and Laura Dietz. 2021. Entity Retrieval Using Fine-Grained Entity Aspects. In _Proceedings of the 44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR â€™21)._

This is an online appendix for the paper. This repository contains
- code associated with this paper and the instructions on how to execute the code. 
- additional resources developed for this paper, including an aspect-linked version of the corpus from [TREC Complex Answer Retrieval](http://trec-car.cs.unh.edu/).

## Running the code
The code is partially in Java and partially in Python. The code has been tested using Java openJDK 13 and Python 3.7. The java code required Maven 3 to be installed. 

To install the java code: 
- Clone this repository using `git clone`. 
- Inside the repository, there are two folders: java (containing the java code) and python (containing the python code). From the java directory, run the following command: `mvn clean install`. This should create a jar file called `SIGIR2021-Short-Final-Code-Release-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` inside `java/target`.

You may now run this jar file using `java -jar SIGIR2021-Short-Final-Code-Release-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` along with various command line arguments (see below)  to create the features for training. 

The folder "python" contains scripts for the following:
1. `bert_entity_rerank.py`: Entity re-ranking using [BERT-as-a-service](https://github.com/hanxiao/bert-as-service).
2. `create-page-id-to-name-mapping.py`: Script to create a mapping from TREC CAR entity-ids to entity-names.
3. `create_query_annotations.py`: Script to annotate TREC CAR queries using TagMe.
4. `entity_rerank.py`: Re-implementation of the entity ranking method from [Gerritse et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02843).

The python scripts have a help function which may be called using the `--help` option with then script. For example, `python entity_rerank.py --help`. 

## Data
1. **Datasets.** We use two datasets in our work:
- TREC CAR. Click [here](http://trec-car.cs.unh.edu/datareleases/) to download the official TREC CAR benchmarks. The experiments in the paper are based on the following two benchmarks: `benchmarkY1-train` and `benchmarkY2-test`. Please download these datasets and the associated qrels. 
- Entity Aspect Linking. Please download the EAL dataset from [here](https://www.cs.unh.edu/~dietz/eal-dataset-2020/entity-aspect-linking-2020.html).
2. **Corpus.** We use the `paragraphCorpus` provided with the TREC CAR dataset. However, the corpus on the official TREC CAR website does not contain entity aspect links; it contains only entity links. Hence, we have aspect-linked the entire corpus using the aspect linker from [Ramsdell et al., 2020](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3340531.3412875).   Click [here](https://unh.box.com/s/arsnh3s7jk2jbrfzb5d7buhhjkwovooj) to download the aspect-linked TREC CAR corpus.

## Our features and other data
Click [here](https://unh.box.com/s/oj9bsxlfl5cwusi9iboo61rib1di3lhd) to download a tar file which contains the passage rankings, entity rankings, support passage rankings, various ground truth files, feature files, etc. used in this work.
